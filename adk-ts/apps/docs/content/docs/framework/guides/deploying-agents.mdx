title: Deploying an Agent
description: This guide explains how to deploy an ADK agent on Railway using a Docker image hosted on DockerHub or via GitHub CI.
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Docker**: Installed and configured on your local machine.
- **DockerHub Account**: To push your Docker image (optional if using GitHub CI).
- **Railway Account**: Sign up at railway.app.
- **ADK-TS Project**: Set up with a `.env` file containing required variables (e.g., `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
- **GitHub Repository**: Your project pushed to GitHub (e.g., your-username/your-repo).

## Steps

### 1. Configure, Build and Push Docker Image

1. **Configure a Dockerfile**\
   Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root directory. This file defines how to build your Docker image:

   ```dockerfile
   # Use Node.js 20 Alpine as the base image (lightweight Linux distribution)
   FROM node:20-alpine

   # Enable pnpm package manager and set a specific version for consistency
   RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9.12.0 --activate

   # Set the working directory inside the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy package files first for better Docker layer caching
   COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
   # Install dependencies using frozen lockfile for reproducible builds
   RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

   # Copy TypeScript configuration
   COPY tsconfig.json ./
   # Copy source code
   COPY src ./src
   # Build the TypeScript project
   RUN pnpm build

   # Set production environment
   ENV NODE_ENV=production

   # Define the command to run when the container starts
   CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
   ```

   **Key Points:**
   - **Alpine Linux**: Lightweight base image for smaller container size
   - **pnpm**: Fast, disk space efficient package manager
   - **Layer Caching**: Copying package files before source code optimizes build time
   - **Frozen Lockfile**: Ensures exact dependency versions for reproducible builds
   - **Production Build**: Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript for runtime

2. **Build the Docker Image**\
   In your project root directory, run one of the following commands to build your Docker image:

   Syntax:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag .
   ```

   For cross-platform compatibility:

   ```bash
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag .
   ```

3. **Push to DockerHub**\
   Log in to DockerHub and push the image:

   ```bash
   docker login
   docker push your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag
   ```

   **Alternative: GitHub CI with Railway**\
   Push your `Dockerfile` to your GitHub repository. Configure a GitHub Actions workflow to build and push the Docker image to DockerHub. Link your Railway project to the GitHub repo, enabling Railway to automatically deploy updates from the CI pipeline.

### 2. Set Up Railway

1. **Create a New Project**

   - Log in to Railway.
   - Click "New Project" and select "Deploy from Docker Image" or connect your GitHub repository.

2. **Configure the Docker Image**

   - For DockerHub: Enter the image name `your_docker_username/your_agent_name:tag`.
   - For GitHub CI: Select your repo and branch; Railway will use the `Dockerfile` from the repository.

3. **Add Environment Variables**

   - In the Railway dashboard, go to "Variables" and add required variables from your `.env` file, e.g.:

     ```
     DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
     LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
     ADK_DEBUG=false
     ```

4. **Deploy the Service**

   - Click "Deploy" to launch the container with your Docker image or GitHub CI build.

### 3. Verify Deployment
- You can test your bot on Telegram/Discord to confirm functionality.

## Common Issues

- **Docker Push Fails**: Ensure DockerHub login and correct image name.
- **Missing Variables**: Verify all environment variables are set in Railway.
- **CI Failure**: Check GitHub Actions logs for build errors.

## Next Steps

- Monitor deployment via Railway logs.
- Update your `Dockerfile` or code, push to GitHub, and redeploy via CI or manually.
