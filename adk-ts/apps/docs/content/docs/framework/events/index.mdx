Events are the fundamental units of information flow within the Agent Development Kit (ADK). They represent every significant occurrence during an agent's interaction lifecycle, from initial user input to the final response and all the steps in between.

## What Events Are

An `Event` in ADK is an immutable record representing a specific point in the agent's execution. It captures:

- **User messages** - Direct input from end users
- **Agent replies** - Responses and actions from agents
- **Tool interactions** - Function calls and their results
- **State changes** - Updates to session state and artifacts
- **Control signals** - Flow control and error conditions

<Callout type="info">
Events serve as the standard message format between the user interface, the `Runner`, agents, the LLM, and tools. Everything flows as an `Event`.
</Callout>

## Event Structure

Events build upon the basic `LlmResponse` structure by adding essential ADK-specific metadata:

```typescript
import { Event, EventActions } from '@iqai/adk';

class Event extends LlmResponse {
  // Core identification
  id: string;                    // Unique event identifier
  invocationId: string;          // ID for the whole interaction run
  author: string;                // 'user' or agent name
  timestamp: number;             // Creation time (seconds since epoch)

  // Content and flow control
  content?: any;                 // Event payload (text, function calls, etc.)
  partial?: boolean;             // True for streaming chunks
  turnComplete?: boolean;        // True when agent's turn is finished

  // ADK-specific features
  actions: EventActions;         // Side-effects & control signals
  longRunningToolIds?: Set<string>; // Background tool execution
  branch?: string;               // Hierarchy path for multi-agent scenarios

  // Helper methods
  isFinalResponse(): boolean;
  getFunctionCalls(): any[];
  getFunctionResponses(): any[];
}
```

## Event Types

### User Events
Events with `author: 'user'` represent direct input from the end-user.

### Agent Events
Events with `author: 'AgentName'` represent output or actions from a specific agent.

### Tool Events
Events containing function calls or responses for tool execution.

### Control Events
Events carrying state changes, control flow signals, or configuration updates.

## Quick Example

Here's a basic example of processing events from an agent:

```typescript
import { LlmAgent, Event } from '@iqai/adk';

// Process events from an agent interaction
for await (const event of runner.runAsync(query, session)) {
  console.log(`Event from: ${event.author}`);

  // Handle different event types
  if (event.content?.parts?.[0]?.text) {
    console.log('Text:', event.content.parts[0].text);
  }

  if (event.getFunctionCalls().length > 0) {
    console.log('Tool calls:', event.getFunctionCalls());
  }

  if (event.actions?.stateDelta) {
    console.log('State changes:', event.actions.stateDelta);
  }

  if (event.isFinalResponse()) {
    console.log('Final response detected');
  }
}
```

## Event Flow in ADK

Events enable communication throughout the ADK system:

1. **User Input** → Creates user event
2. **Agent Processing** → Generates agent events with text or tool calls
3. **Tool Execution** → Creates tool response events
4. **State Updates** → Tracked via event actions
5. **Final Response** → Delivered as final event ready for display

<Callout type="info">
The sequence of events recorded in `session.events` provides a complete, chronological history of an interaction, invaluable for debugging, auditing, and understanding agent behavior.
</Callout>

## Key Features

### State Management
Events carry state changes through `actions.stateDelta`, allowing components to update session state reactively.

### Artifact Tracking
File operations and artifact versions are tracked through `actions.artifactDelta`.

### Control Flow
Events can signal agent transfers (`transferToAgent`), loop termination (`escalate`), and other control flow changes.

### Streaming Support
Events support real-time streaming with `partial` flags for progressive content delivery.

### Error Handling
Events inherit error properties (`errorCode`, `errorMessage`) for comprehensive error tracking.

Events are the backbone of ADK's communication system, enabling powerful features like state management, tool orchestration, and complex agent workflows. Explore the detailed guides above to learn how to leverage events effectively in your applications.
