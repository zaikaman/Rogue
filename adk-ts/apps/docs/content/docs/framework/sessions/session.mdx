import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Sessions represent one conversation thread. They keep the message history and scoped state needed to maintain context across turns—much like a chat thread in a messaging app.

## The Session Object

When a user starts interacting with your agent, the `SessionService` creates a `Session` object (`google.adk.sessions.Session`). This object acts as the container holding everything related to that _one specific chat thread_. Here are its key properties:

-   **Identification (`id`, `appName`, `userId`):** Unique labels for the conversation.
    -   `id`: A unique identifier for _this specific_ conversation thread, essential for retrieving it later. A SessionService object can handle multiple `Session`(s). This field identifies which particular session object are we referring to. For example, "test\_id\_modification".
    -   `app_name`: Identifies which agent application this conversation belongs to. For example, "id\_modifier\_workflow".
    -   `userId`: Links the conversation to a particular user.
-   **History (`events`):** A chronological sequence of all interactions (`Event` objects – user messages, agent responses, tool actions) that have occurred within this specific thread.
-   **Session State (`state`):** A place to store temporary data relevant _only_ to this specific, ongoing conversation. This acts as a scratchpad for the agent during the interaction. We will cover how to use and manage `state` in detail in the next section.
-   **Activity Tracking (`lastUpdateTime`):** A timestamp indicating the last time an event occurred in this conversation thread.

## Managing Sessions with a `SessionService`

As seen above, you don't typically create or manage `Session` objects directly. Instead, you use a **`SessionService`**. This service acts as the central manager responsible for the entire lifecycle of your conversation sessions.

Its core responsibilities include:

-   **Starting New Conversations:** Creating fresh `Session` objects when a user begins an interaction.
-   **Resuming Existing Conversations:** Retrieving a specific `Session` (using its ID) so the agent can continue where it left off.
-   **Saving Progress:** Appending new interactions (`Event` objects) to a session's history. This is also the mechanism through which session `state` gets updated (more in the `State` section).
-   **Listing Conversations:** Finding the active session threads for a particular user and application.
-   **Cleaning Up:** Deleting `Session` objects and their associated data when conversations are finished or no longer needed.

## Implementation Options

### In-memory (development)

Fast and simple for development/testing.

```typescript
import { InMemorySessionService } from '@iqai/adk';

const sessionService = new InMemorySessionService();

// Create session
const session = await sessionService.createSession(
  'my-app',
  'user123',
  {
    current_step: 'welcome',
    'user:theme': 'dark'
  }
);
```

Use when you don't need persistence between restarts.

### Database (production-ready persistence)

Persistent storage using PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite. Choose a specific factory or use the generic auto-detect helper.

#### PostgreSQL

```typescript
import { createPostgresSessionService, createDatabaseSessionService } from '@iqai/adk';

// Direct (requires peer dep: pg)
const sessionService = createPostgresSessionService(
  'postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db'
);

// Or auto-detect
const sessionService = createDatabaseSessionService('postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db');
```

#### MySQL

```typescript
import { createMysqlSessionService, createDatabaseSessionService } from '@iqai/adk';

// Direct (requires peer dep: mysql2)
const sessionService = createMysqlSessionService(
  'mysql://user:pass@host:3306/db'
);

// Or auto-detect
const sessionService = createDatabaseSessionService('mysql://user:pass@host:3306/db');
```

#### SQLite

```typescript
import { createSqliteSessionService, createDatabaseSessionService } from '@iqai/adk';

// Direct (requires peer dep: better-sqlite3)
const sessionService = createSqliteSessionService('sessions.db');

// Or auto-detect (both forms are supported)
const sessionService = createDatabaseSessionService('sqlite://sessions.db');
const sessionService2 = createDatabaseSessionService('sessions.db');
```

Once you have a `sessionService`, use it the same way regardless of the database:

```typescript
// Create a session
const session = await sessionService.createSession(
  'my-app',
  'user123',
  {
    current_step: 'welcome',
    'user:preferred_language': 'es',
    'app:version': '2.0'
  }
);
```

Notes:
- Tables are created automatically by default
- Prefixes are handled for you: `app:` → app_states, `user:` → user_states, unprefixed → sessions

<Callout type="info" title="Database peer dependencies">
Install one of: `better-sqlite3` (SQLite), `pg` (PostgreSQL), or `mysql2` (MySQL), depending on your database.
</Callout>

### Cloud (Vertex AI Agent Engine)

Scalable, managed storage on Google Cloud.

```typescript
import { VertexAiSessionService } from '@iqai/adk';

const sessionService = new VertexAiSessionService({
  project: 'your-gcp-project',
  location: 'us-central1',
  agentEngineId: 'your-agent-engine-id' // Optional: can use appName as reasoning engine ID
});

// Create session (sessionId is auto-generated)
const session = await sessionService.createSession(
  'projects/your-project/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/12345',
  'user123',
  {
    current_step: 'welcome',
    'user:language': 'en'
  }
);
```

Use when you want fully managed persistence and scale.

## Session Lifecycle

Here’s a simplified flow of how `Session` and `SessionService` work together during a conversation turn:

1.  **Start or Resume:** Your application needs to use the `SessionService` to either `createSession` (for a new chat) or use an existing session id.
2.  **Context Provided:** The `Runner` gets the appropriate `Session` object from the appropriate service method, providing the agent with access to the corresponding Session's `state` and `events`.
3.  **Agent Processing:** The user prompts the agent with a query. The agent analyzes the query and potentially the session `state` and `events` history to determine the response.
4.  **Response & State Update:** The agent generates a response (and potentially flags data to be updated in the `state`). The `Runner` packages this as an `Event`.
5.  **Save Interaction:** The `Runner` calls `sessionService.appendEvent(session, event)` with the `session` and the new `event` as the arguments. The service adds the `Event` to the history and updates the session's `state` in storage based on information within the event. The session's `lastUpdateTime` also get updated.
6.  **Ready for Next:** The agent's response goes to the user. The updated `Session` is now stored by the `SessionService`, ready for the next turn (which restarts the cycle at step 1, usually with the continuation of the conversation in the current session).
7.  **End Conversation:** When the conversation is over, your application calls `sessionService.deleteSession(...)` to clean up the stored session data if it is no longer required.

This cycle highlights how the `SessionService` ensures conversational continuity by managing the history and state associated with each `Session` object.
