LangGraph agents orchestrate sophisticated workflows with conditional branching, dynamic routing, and state-dependent decisions. Think of them as the master conductors for complex, multi-path processes where the next step depends on the results of previous steps.

Unlike simple workflow patterns ([sequential](/docs/framework/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents), [parallel](/docs/framework/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents), [loop](/docs/framework/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents)), LangGraph agents handle complex decision trees, conditional flows, and dynamic routing based on content analysis, user preferences, or business rules.

<Callout type="info" title="Advanced Orchestration">
  - **Power:** Handle complex branching logic and conditional workflows
  - **Flexibility:** Dynamic routing based on content, context, or business rules
  - **Best for:** Sophisticated processes that require intelligent
  decision-making
</Callout>

## Quick Start Example

Here's a customer support system that intelligently routes inquiries based on analysis:

```typescript
import { LlmAgent, LangGraphAgent } from "@iqai/adk";

// Step 1: Analyze incoming inquiry
const inquiryAnalyzer = new LlmAgent({
  name: "inquiry-analyzer",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction: `
    Analyze the customer inquiry and determine:
    - Category: technical, billing, general, complaint, refund
    - Urgency: low, medium, high, critical
    - Complexity: simple, moderate, complex
    - Sentiment: positive, neutral, negative, angry
    
    Output as JSON with these fields.
  `,
  outputKey: "analysis",
});

// Specialized handlers for different types
const technicalSupport = new LlmAgent({
  name: "technical-support",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Handle technical issues with step-by-step troubleshooting guidance.",
  outputKey: "technical_response",
});

const billingSupport = new LlmAgent({
  name: "billing-support",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Handle billing inquiries with account-specific information and resolution steps.",
  outputKey: "billing_response",
});

const escalationHandler = new LlmAgent({
  name: "escalation-handler",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Handle escalated issues requiring human intervention with empathy and next steps.",
  outputKey: "escalation_response",
});

const generalSupport = new LlmAgent({
  name: "general-support",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  instruction:
    "Handle general inquiries with helpful information and guidance.",
  outputKey: "general_response",
});

// Define the workflow graph with conditional routing
const supportWorkflow = new LangGraphAgent({
  name: "customer-support-workflow",
  description: "Intelligent customer support routing and handling",
  nodes: [
    {
      id: "analyze",
      agent: inquiryAnalyzer,
      next: (ctx) => {
        const analysis = JSON.parse(ctx.session.state.get("analysis", "{}"));

        // Route based on analysis results
        if (analysis.urgency === "critical" || analysis.sentiment === "angry") {
          return "escalate";
        }

        switch (analysis.category) {
          case "technical":
            return "technical";
          case "billing":
          case "refund":
            return "billing";
          default:
            return "general";
        }
      },
    },
    {
      id: "technical",
      agent: technicalSupport,
      next: () => "end",
    },
    {
      id: "billing",
      agent: billingSupport,
      next: (ctx) => {
        // Check if billing issue was resolved
        const response = ctx.session.state.get("billing_response", "");
        return response.includes("unresolved") ? "escalate" : "end";
      },
    },
    {
      id: "escalate",
      agent: escalationHandler,
      next: () => "end",
    },
    {
      id: "general",
      agent: generalSupport,
      next: () => "end",
    },
  ],
  startNode: "analyze",
});

// Usage: Intelligent routing based on inquiry content
const result = await supportWorkflow.run({
  message:
    "My billing is completely wrong and I'm very frustrated! I need this fixed immediately!",
});
// → Routes to escalation due to angry sentiment and billing category
```

## How LangGraph Processing Works

LangGraph agents enable sophisticated workflow orchestration through conditional routing and state-dependent decisions:

**🌐 Node-Based Architecture**

- **Nodes:** Individual processing steps (typically agents)
- **Edges:** Conditional transitions between nodes
- **State:** Shared context that influences routing decisions
- **Dynamic routing:** Next step determined by current state and results

**🧠 Intelligent Decision Making**

1. **Execute current node** - Run the agent at current workflow position
2. **Evaluate state** - Analyze results and current context
3. **Determine next step** - Use conditional logic to choose next node
4. **Route dynamically** - Move to appropriate next node or terminate

**🔀 Conditional Flows**

```typescript
next: (ctx) => {
  const analysis = ctx.session.state.get("analysis");

  if (analysis.urgency === "critical") return "escalate";
  if (analysis.category === "technical") return "tech-support";
  return "general-support";
};
```

**📊 State Management**

- All nodes share the same session state
- Previous results influence future routing decisions
- Context accumulates throughout the workflow
- Decisions can reference any previous step's output

<Callout type="info" title="Graph Design Patterns">
  - **Start simple:** Begin with basic routing logic, add complexity gradually
  - **Plan thoroughly:** Map out all possible paths before implementation
  - **Handle edge cases:** Always have fallback routes for unexpected conditions
</Callout>

## Advanced Patterns

### Multi-Stage Decision Trees

```typescript
const nodes = [
  {
    id: "initial-triage",
    agent: triageAgent,
    next: (ctx) => {
      const triage = ctx.session.state.get("triage");
      return triage.requiresHuman ? "human-review" : "automated-processing";
    },
  },
  {
    id: "automated-processing",
    agent: automatedProcessor,
    next: (ctx) => {
      const result = ctx.session.state.get("automated_result");
      return result.confidence > 0.9 ? "finalize" : "human-review";
    },
  },
  {
    id: "human-review",
    agent: humanReviewAgent,
    next: () => "finalize",
  },
  {
    id: "finalize",
    agent: finalizationAgent,
    next: () => "end",
  },
];
```

### Loop Within Graph

```typescript
{
  id: "quality-check",
  agent: qualityAssessor,
  next: (ctx) => {
    const quality = ctx.session.state.get("quality_score");
    const attempts = ctx.session.state.get("improvement_attempts", 0);

    if (quality >= 8) return "approve";
    if (attempts >= 3) return "escalate";
    return "improve"; // Loop back for another improvement cycle
  }
}
```

### Parallel Processing Integration

```typescript
{
  id: "parallel-analysis",
  agent: parallelAnalysisAgent, // This could be a ParallelAgent
  next: (ctx) => {
    const results = ctx.session.state.get("parallel_results");
    const consensus = analyzeConsensus(results);
    return consensus.agreement > 0.8 ? "proceed" : "additional-review";
  }
}
```

## When to Choose LangGraph Agents

<Callout type="success" title="Perfect for Complex Decision Trees">
  - **Use when:** You need sophisticated branching logic and conditional
  workflows
  - **Benefit:** Handle complex processes that simple linear or
  parallel patterns can't address
</Callout>

### ✅ Choose LangGraph When:

- **Complex routing logic** - Next step depends on content analysis or business rules
- **Multi-path workflows** - Different paths through the process based on conditions
- **State-dependent decisions** - Routing changes based on accumulated context
- **Exception handling** - Need sophisticated error handling and escalation paths
- **Adaptive processes** - Workflow adapts based on intermediate results
- **Integration of patterns** - Combining sequential, parallel, and loop behaviors

### ❌ Don't Use LangGraph When:

- Simple linear workflows are sufficient (use Sequential)
- All tasks can run independently (use Parallel)
- Simple iteration is needed (use Loop)
- Workflow complexity outweighs the benefits
- Debugging and maintenance overhead is too high

## Design Best Practices

### 1. Start with Flow Mapping

```
Before coding, map out:
- All possible entry points
- Decision criteria at each branch
- All possible exit conditions
- Error handling and fallback paths
```

### 2. Keep Nodes Focused

```typescript
// Good: Single responsibility
const riskAssessor = new LlmAgent({
  instruction: "Assess financial risk only",
});

// Avoid: Multiple responsibilities
const everythingAgent = new LlmAgent({
  instruction: "Assess risk, make decisions, and format output",
});
```

### 3. Handle Edge Cases

```typescript
next: (ctx) => {
  const analysis = ctx.session.state.get("analysis");

  // Always handle missing or malformed data
  if (!analysis) return "error-handler";

  // Provide fallback for unexpected values
  switch (analysis.category) {
    case "technical":
      return "tech-support";
    case "billing":
      return "billing-support";
    default:
      return "general-support"; // Fallback
  }
};
```

### 4. Test All Paths

```
Ensure every possible route through your graph:
- Has been tested with real data
- Handles expected and edge case scenarios
- Has appropriate error handling
- Can reach a terminal state
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Graph Complexity Warning">
  - **Start simple:** Complex graphs are hard to debug and maintain
  - **Document thoroughly:** Clear documentation is crucial for complex flows
  - **Test extensively:** Every path and edge case should be tested
</Callout>
