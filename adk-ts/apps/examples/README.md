## 🌟 Overview

This directory contains a collection of comprehensive examples that demonstrate how to utilize the Agent Development Kit (ADK) for TypeScript in real-world scenarios. You can use these examples to learn how to build AI agents, integrate tools, manage memory, and implement advanced features.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before running the examples, here's what you need:

- **Node.js 22.0+** (or as specified in the `package.json` file)
- **API Keys** for your chosen LLM provider(s)

*Note: this project uses [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager. You can use other package managers, but to have a better experience, please install pnpm globally on your system.*

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository and Install the Dependencies**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/IQAIcom/adk-ts.git
  cd adk-ts
  pnpm install
```

2. **Build the ADK-TS Package**

For the examples to work correctly, you need to build the core ADK-TS package first. This step compiles the TypeScript code and prepares the necessary files.

 ```bash
   pnpm build
 ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the **examples directory** (not in the root folder) and add your API keys and optional model configuration. This file is used to set environment variables that the examples will use.

 ```bash
   # apps/examples/.env

   # Optional: Specify which model to use
   LLM_MODEL=your_model_name

   # Required: At least one API key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
 ```

The default LLM is Google Gemini. You can get a Google API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey). If you want to use a different model, you can specify it in the `.env` file using the `LLM_MODEL` variable or update it directly in the example code.

> Note: Some examples require additional configuration or dependencies. Please check the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file for specific instructions.

4. **Run Examples**

To explore the examples, you can either browse all available examples or run a specific one directly:

 ```bash
   cd apps/examples 
   
   # Interactive mode - browse and select an example
   pnpm start
   
   # Or run a specific example directly
   pnpm start --name 01-simple-agent
   pnpm start --name 11-mcp-integrations
 ```

💡 **Pro Tip**: Follow the examples in order (01-16) for a structured learning path, or jump to specific examples based on your needs. Start with `01-simple-agent` to understand the basics, then explore advanced features like MCP integrations, event compaction, callbacks, and specialized agents!
